description: If we move west from the previous slide we see the continental margin
  sediments sourced from the east inter-finger with the conglomerates sourced from
  the Antler Orogeny in the foredeep. In the central part of the foredeep, the sediments
  are 5-6 km thick, but if you go east, out of the foredeep, toward the continentally
  derived sediments, you find for the same time period sediments that are 300-400m
  thick. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
