description: This next image portrays the timing of different depositional events
  around the time of the Antler Orogeny. You can see that the Arc Volcanism continued
  throughout the time that the Antler was created. You can also see that the sediment
  found in the Antler Allochthon were experiencing active deposition until ~360ma.
  The filling of the foredeep then starts ~355ma, suggesting that the material had
  been thrust over the sinking continental margin. By ~350ma, we find sediments overlapping
  the Antler Orogeny, suggesting that it had been significantly eroded. The dates
  in this figure are old, and though we do not need to know the exact numbers right
  now, it is important to think about the different forms of geologic evidence available
  for constraining when certain events happened. Note that deposition continues in
  the Havallah basin east of the arc and west of the developing Antler Mountain belt.
  This suggests there was no arc collision during Antler time. Image courtesy of Professor
  Burchfiel.
