description: "This is another image of m\xE9lange. As you can see the rocks are highly\
  \ deformed, sheared and folded. Only a mother could love these rocks. Within the\
  \ m\xE9lange, we find mixed exotic fossils including those of both North American\
  \ and Asian affinity. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel."
