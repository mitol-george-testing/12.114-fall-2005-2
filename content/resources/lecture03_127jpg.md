description: "We now consider the time between the middle Jurassic (Jr) and the late\
  \ Cretaceous (K). In this image you can see the red magmatic arc mountain belt extending\
  \ up the entire western edge of NA. Within the U.S., the sequence of geologic environments\
  \ is relatively consistent along this margin. From west to east, the regions are:\
  \ Accretionary Prism / Fore Arc / Arc Intrusions / Metamorphic zones related to\
  \ the intrusions / back arc fold and thrust belt / Fore-Deep Basin. The eastern\
  \ extent of this fold and thrust belt is shown by the outline labeled as Sevier\
  \ Belt. The grey-brown coloring indicates the location of the fore-deep east of\
  \ the fold and thrust belt. Note that this deformational and depositional style\
  \ does not extend south to the Mojave region. The situation in Canada is different\u2014\
  arc collisions continue into the Cretaceous and the subduction zone and its associated\
  \ magmatic arc migrate to the west. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel."
