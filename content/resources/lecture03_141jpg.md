description: In a lot of geologic thinking, we too often expect compressional deformation
  to be accordion-style where all movement is in the direction of compression. But
  we need to consider lateral and oblique movement as well. In the Cordillera, we
  find large number of Mesozoic strike-slip faults capable of facilitating large magnitude
  displacements. These structures are dominantly right lateral and trend toward the
  northwest, commensurate with the interaction between the subducting oceanic crust
  and North America. The magnitude of the displacements on these structures is hotly
  debated to this day. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel.
