description: "From the low angle of the shadows you can see we start early in the\
  \ day. Those groups responsible for breakfast preparation start a half hour early.\
  \ We also make our lunches during breakfast time. This is your chow for the day\
  \ and is very important to make a good lunch. The saying goes, \u201Ca geologist\
  \ is never far from his/her lunch.\u201D When doing field work it is never a good\
  \ idea to leave your food or pack behind as you might intend to just run up quickly\
  \ to one outcrop, but in the end you may end up getting excited and follow a feature\
  \ half way across the field area before you realize it is time for lunch and your\
  \ food is way back over there. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel."
