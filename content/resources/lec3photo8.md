description: In this image we see the ashes and sediments associated with the late
  Paleozoic island arcs that have experienced epidote alteration. That is what gives
  them their blue-green color. Though these volcanically derived deposits were created
  at the same time as the Antler, there are no evidence of ashes or volcanic fragments
  in the Antler-related sediments, suggesting that the Arcs were still far away from
  the edge of North America during Antler time. -------------- An interesting thing
  to know about the sediments created in Arc Complexes is that most of the volume
  of material that we see is not the primary eruptive deposits but rather the materials
  eroded off the volcanic edifices. Thus they are mostly sedimentary deposits derived
  from volcanic materials. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
