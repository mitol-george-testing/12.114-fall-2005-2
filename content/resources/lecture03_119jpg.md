description: "In these cross sections we compare the differences between the northwest\
  \ and the southwest part of the continental margin. Along the northwest part of\
  \ the margin (W NV), we see the red Sonoma terrane accreted to NA and the fold and\
  \ thrust belt active further inland. At the same time (moving horizontally across\
  \ the figure), the SE part of the margin has experienced rifting or a transform\
  \ fault that has juxtaposed the thick Precambrian crust (white) covered with thin\
  \ passive margin sediments against thin oceanic crust.\r\nLater in time we see in\
  \ the NW that the polarity of subduction switched from west dipping to east dipping,\
  \ effectively changing the plate margin from a \u2018South-Pacific\u2019 style margin\
  \ to a \u2018Andean\u2019 style margin. As well, in the backarc environment, there\
  \ is extension and deposition in the West Nevada Triassic basin. Along the SW portion\
  \ of the plate margin, east dipping subduction is also active, but because the continental\
  \ crust is dominantly thick, buoyant Precambrian crust, there is no back-arc extension\
  \ (as in the case in W NV) and instead, there are structures indicative of compression.\
