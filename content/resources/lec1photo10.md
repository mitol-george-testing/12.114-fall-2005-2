description: We will stay together as one big group on the first day. We will introduce
  you to the regional geology and the rocks that we will be working in. This will
  be your only introduction to the field area. The rest of the time you will map in
  independent groups. Instructors will rotate among the groups, but it will be ultimately
  up to you to figure out what is going on. The best way to learn field geology is
  just to get out there and do it. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
