description: "These are the highly altered volcanic rocks of an island arc that have\
  \ been accreted against North America at the end of the Paleozoic. The rocks are\
  \ green because of chlorite alteration during the circulation hydrothermal waters\
  \ near the volcano. The rocks are Cambrian, the same age as the slates and distal\
  \ rocks thrust up during the Antler Orogeny\u2026but these are tough to work in\u2026\
  they are a geochemist\u2019s nightmare. Hats off to those who can do this work!\
