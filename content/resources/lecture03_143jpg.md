description: "In this image we can see a change in the behavior of the Arc environment.\
  \ To the north in Canada we find the intrusive arc continues to emplace large igneous\
  \ bodies. This is also true in the Mojave region in the southwest corner of north\
  \ America, but as discussed earlier, the fold and thrust belt active along much\
  \ of western NA is becoming less active to inactive in its central segment. In the\
  \ southwest U.S., because most of the passive margin sequence was sheared off by\
  \ the late Paleozoic truncation, the deformation is complicated by the presence\
  \ of thick continental basement. The deformation is accomplished by much more ductile\
  \ shear and metamorphism and a discontinuous and irregular fold and thrust belt.\
  \ During the end Cretaceous, in between the Canadian arc and the Mojave region,\
  \ the arc intrusions stop but the m\xE9langes deposited in the accretionary wedges\
  \ continue. Subduction remains active but the arc extinguishes\u2026Why? Looking\
  \ further east, you can see that large scale inter-continental deformation is occurring\
  \ via block uplifts of Precambrian basement and deposition of sediments in adjacent\
  \ basins within the cratonic rocks east of the former Paleozoic passive margin.\
  \ It is suggested that these observations are a consequence of a change in the dip\
  \ of the subducting slab. As the slab-dip shallows, subduction continues to build\
  \ the accretionary wedge, but the down-going slab is not deep enough or hot enough\
  \ to melt/dewater and produce igneous activity in the overlying mantle wedge. Where\
  \ the slab does begin to dip, heat is concentrated against the base of the crust,\
  \ but because the heat is applied to the base of thick continental crust, the deformational\
  \ activity is expressed as the block uplifts rather than Arc volcanics forming the\
  \ Laramide Colo-Wyoming Rocky Mountains. It is not known why the slab changed from\
  \ steeply dipping to shallowly dipping, but research in northern Argentina (where\
  \ there is also shallow-slab subduction), may shed light on this process. Courtesy\
