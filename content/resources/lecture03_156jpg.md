description: In this final slide, you can see the present configuration of the western
  edge of NA. Arc volcanism continues in the Cascades above the subduction zone there.
  A hot-spot impinging on the crust has created the volcanism in the Snake River Plain
  that migrated eastward and presently drives deformation and high heat flow in and
  around Yellowstone. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel.
