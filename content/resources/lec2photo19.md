description: And this slide is in here just to show that though I may present a relatively
  coherent story of the western edge of America, there are still things that we do
  not understand. These rocks are a laterally extensive Paleozoic quartzite and we
  just don't understand where they were deposited. All the deformation and accretion
  leave the rock record in a state where deciphering what happened when is never easy.
