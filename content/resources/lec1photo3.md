description: This is the map tent where we store the computers and the mapping equipment.
  It is where we will eat if the weather is bad but most of the time we will use this
  tent for doing the digital mapping work at night. We have generators and batteries
  for electricity but will use gas lanterns for light. These tents are high quality
  arctic tents and have served us well. We purchased them with gracious support from
  the Kaplan Foundation. There is a lot of wind in the desert, especially at night
  and, our old tents were knocked over frequently. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
