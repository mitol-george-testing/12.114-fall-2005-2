description: "In this image, the purple, Star Peak basin is where the West Nevada\
  \ Triassic basin sediments were deposited in the back arc environment following\
  \ development of the early Andean-style continental magmatic arc. The green-gray\
  \ rocks are the arc volcanics along the edge of NA. South of the Canadian border,\
  \ the rocks are all forming in situ, but north of the border, island arcs continue\
  \ to collide with western British Colombia through the Jurassic and Cretaceous.\
  \ Localities that have a \u2018t\u2019 next to them have oceanic sediments of Tethyan\
  \ origin, indicating Asiatic origin. The \u2018bs\u2019 signifies the location of\
  \ high pressure and low temperature metamorphic rocks characteristic of a subduction\
  \ environment. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel."
