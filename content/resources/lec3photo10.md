description: Though these rocks are the source of the rocks that we traditionally
  think of as igneous, we would call these rocks metamorphic because they are under
  temperatures and pressures where they are ductilly deformed. In this image, the
  bands that we see in this rock are due to ductile flow in the mantle adjacent to
  the mid-oceanic ridge. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
