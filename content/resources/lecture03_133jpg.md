description: "In this image we can see the Cordilleran fold and thrust belt in Canada.\
  \ Some have described the structural form of arc environments using the following\
  \ unique terminology. The accretionary wedge is called the \u2018Synthetic Thrust\
  \ Belt,\u2019 where the direction of shear on the down-going plate is the same as\
  \ the direction of shear within the wedge. The fold and thrust belt in back arc\
  \ is referred to as the \u2018Antithetic Thrust Belt\u2019 because the direction\
  \ of the shear is opposite to the direction of shear in the subduction zone. Here\
  \ is a cross section of the antithetic thrust belt in Canada that involves the Paleozoic\
  \ sediments of the passive margin and young Mesozoic sediments. Courtesy of Prof.\
  \ Burchfiel."
