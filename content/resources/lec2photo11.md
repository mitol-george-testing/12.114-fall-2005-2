description: "In the lowest part of the passive margin sediments you see rocks like\
  \ this: coarse, poorly sorted, angular to well rounded sedimentary clasts supported\
  \ by a fine grain matrix. Sedimentary rocks with this texture are know as a \u2018\
  Diamictite.\u2019 ------------------- The interesting thing about this diamictite\
  \ is that some of the clasts have scratches or shallow linear groves cut into them.\
  \ These groves are indicative of glacial transport. When the glacier is sliding\
  \ down slope on the basal bedrock, there are often clasts that are imbedded in the\
  \ ice that are dragging across the underlying rock. This dragging creates the groves\
  \ or \u2018striations\u2019 on the clasts. -------------------- There are no dateable\
  \ ash horizons or other opportunities for direct dating. But, if the texture and\
  \ striations demonstrate that this deposit is indeed glacial, then we have a good\
  \ sense of the age of the initiation of sedimentation on the passive margin of North\
  \ America. If these deposits belong to the well-studied, globally synchronous glacial\
  \ period in the late Proterozoic, then we can bracket the initiation of sedimentation\
  \ somewhere between 650 and 600 ma. This image is from Canada. Image courtesy of\
