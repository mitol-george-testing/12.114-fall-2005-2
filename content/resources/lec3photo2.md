description: "In this image we see the Robert\u2019s Mountain thrust contact up close.\
  \ Above the contact we see the Early Missisppian conglomerates (but shouldn\u2019\
  t this be the distal sediments) and below we see a thick band of sheared rocks.\
  \ To constrain the age of a thrust fault like this, you need to know the age of\
  \ the youngest rocks in the footwall and the oldest age of the sediments produced\
  \ by the deformation (the oldest age of the foredeep sediments). For the Roberts\
  \ Mountain thrust, we know that the fault was active over roughly 10 million years.\
