description: "In this dark image you can see a group of geologists examining an outcrop\u2026\
  When we go into the field we try to go to an area that has not been mapped in much\
  \ detail before. Some regions in the west have been mapped over and over again and\
  \ trails follow the contacts and that takes all the fun out of discovering the geology.\
  \ Plus, doing work in a new area means making a contribution to our geologic understanding\
  \ of the southwest. This contributes to science. This also means that the instructors\
  \ are just as unfamiliar with the field area as the students are and it gives the\
  \ students and opportunity to observe how a geologist really goes about doing their\
  \ work. It keeps the instructors curious and on their toes as well. Geology is not\
  \ always straight-forward and there will be times when we are all confused together\
  \ and we will have to find the best explanation we can. Image courtesy of Professor\
  \ Burchfiel."
