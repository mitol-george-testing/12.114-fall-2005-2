description: "The final part that we will discuss today has to do with the End Devonian\
  \ to the Early Mississippian (~350-340 ma). During this period we find the western\
  \ edge of NA switching from a passive margin to an active one where deformation\
  \ due to subduction has thrust the distal sediments of a \u2018phase 2\u2019 age\
  \ up and over the near-shore passive margin sediments. This mountain building event,\
  \ called the Antler Orogeny and was driven by convergent mountain building whose\
  \ origin remains a subject of much controversy. This constructed a large mountain\
  \ range bounded on the east by the leading edge of the thrust (the Robert\u2019\
  s Mountain thrust). The loading of the crust due to the emplacement of the thrust\
  \ sheet created a flexural depression in the crust (the Antler Foredeep) on the\
  \ east side of the mountains. This depression or foredeep was then the locus of\
  \ deposition for sediments eroded off the Antler Orogeny. The age of the distal\
  \ sediments overthrust in the Antler Orogeny are the same as the near shore passive\
  \ margin and the fossils within the distal sediment are also of North American affinity.\
  \ This then explains that this overthurst material was \u2018indigenous\u2019 (or\
  \ contiguous with the footwall rock) rather than \u2018exotic\u2019 as the island\
  \ arcs are. Though the Antler Orogeny was due to the interaction of convergent activity\
  \ along the western edge of north America, it would not be the last. There are plenty\
  \ more to come! Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel."
