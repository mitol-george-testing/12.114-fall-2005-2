description: This image is a cross section demonstrating the two phases of deposition
  on the passive margin of NA. The lower part of the section is the first phase of
  deposition and you see it was dominantly a thick sequence of non-marine nearshore
  deltaic and sandy deposits. The second phase was after the strengthening of the
  margin, the slowing of subsidence and the deposition of nearshore, marine carbonate
  deposits. You can see on the left side of the slide that during the second phase
  we also had the deposition of the distal, fine-grained materials that had been thrust
  back over the passive margin. Again, Las Vegas is at the hinge line, and you can
  see that there was discontinuous deposition east of there, it just was not as thick
  as on the subsiding passive margin. This slide also raises the point that we must
  be careful when we interpret cross sections, at the vertical exaggeration can be
  deceiving. You can see below the unexaggerated section. Image courtesy of Professor
  Burchfiel.
